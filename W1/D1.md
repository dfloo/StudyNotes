Graphs
A Graph is defined as a set of vertices (or nodes) and edges (or links) 
G = (V, E)

Graphs can be directed or undirected.

Graphs can be strongly or weakly connected. 

vertices can be weighted or unweighted

REST
Stands for Representational State Transfer
coined by Roy T. Fielding
The Fielding constraints that a system must satisfy in order to be considered RESTful:
-Client Server
  -The first Fielding Constraint specifies that the network must be made up of clients and servers. A server is a computer that has resources of interest, and a client is a computer that wants to interact with the resources stored on the server. When you browse the Internet, your computer is acting as a client and sends HTTP requests to a server in order to access and manipulate information. A RESTful system has to operate in the client-server model, even if a component sometimes acts like a client and sometimes acts like a server.
  A non-RESTful alternative to client-server architecture is event-based integration architecture. 

-Stateless
  Stateless does not mean that servers and clients do not have state, it simply means that they do not need to keep track of each other’s state. When a client is not interacting with the server, the server has no idea of its existence. The server also does not keep a record of past requests. Each request is treated as a standalone.

-Uniform Interface
  The “uniform interface” constraint ensures that there is a common language between servers and clients that allows each part to be swapped out or modified without breaking the entire system. This is achieved through 4 sub-constraints: 
    -identification of resources 
    -manipulation of resources through representations
    -self-descriptive messages
    -hypermedia.

-Caching
-Layered System
