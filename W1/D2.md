CSS Grid:
  - Grid layouts are fundamental to the design of websites, and the CSS Grid module is the most powerful and easiest tool for creating it.
  - The two core ingredients of a CSS Grid are the wrapper (parent) and the items (children). The wrapper is the actual grid and the items are the content inside the grid.
  ```html
  <div class="wrapper">
    <div>1</div>
    <div>2</div>
    <div>3</div>
    <div>4</div>
    <div>5</div>
    <div>6</div>
  </div>
  ```
